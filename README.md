# AI-CV-Face-Detection-And-Head-Count-
This project utilizes OpenCV with pre-trained models like Haarcascades Classifier for precise face detection and head counting. Initially for webcam, optimized for input images. Haarcascades selected over DNN for accuracy. Fine-tuned parameters yielded optimal results, with bounding boxes showing detected faces and count in fullscreen output.
